# gleam_htmx_tw

This project is a basic clean starter that is still WIP. The idea is to have an usable Gleam, HTMX and Tailwind experience.

## Development

```sh
watchexec -r -e gleam,html -- gleam run
```

## Acknowledgements
This project looks similar to [ad-ops/gleam-htmx](https://github.com/ad-ops/gleam-htmx), but my objective is to provide a different DX from it by using BBMustache's Templating HTML templating instead of Nakai's. And of course, add tailwind support.
