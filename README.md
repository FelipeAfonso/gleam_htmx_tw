# gleam_htmx_tw

This project is a basic clean starter that is still WIP. The idea is to have an usable Gleam, HTMX and Tailwind experience.

## Development

Use the following command to start your web page at http://localhost:3000
```sh
gleam run dev #with hot reload
gleam run #without hr, ideally for prod environments 
```

## Acknowledgements
This project looks similar to [ad-ops/gleam-htmx](https://github.com/ad-ops/gleam-htmx), but my objective is to provide a different DX from it by using BBMustache's Templating HTML templating instead of Nakai's. And of course, add tailwind support.
